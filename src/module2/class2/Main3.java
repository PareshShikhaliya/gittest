/*
you can create a subclass of an abstract class without overriding its abstract methods.
When you create a concrete subclass of an abstract class, you have two options:

Override Abstract Methods:
    In this case, you must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods defined in the abstract
     class. This is necessary to make the subclass concrete so that it can be instantiated.

Remain Abstract:
 If you don't want to provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods in the subclass,
  you can choose to keep the subclass abstract as well. In this scenario, the subclass will also be an abstract class and cannot be directly instantiated. It can, however, be further subclassed by other concrete or abstract classes, which will be responsible for implementing the abstract methods.
