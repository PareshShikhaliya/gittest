Difference between Composition, Aggregation, and Inheritance:

Relationship Type:

Composition represents a "whole-part" relationship and is usually used for building complex objects.
Aggregation represents a "whole-part" relationship but allows the "part" to exist independently.
Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and is used for creating a hierarchy of classes with a specialization relationship.
Object Lifecycle:

In Composition, the composed objects are created and destroyed along with the container object's lifecycle.
In Aggregation, the aggregated objects can exist independently and are not affected by the container object's lifecycle.
In Inheritance, the subclass inherits the properties and methods of the superclass and can extend or override them but has a separate lifecycle.
Dependency:

Composition and Aggregation represent a stronger form of dependency between classes compared to Inheritance.
Inheritance can lead to a more rigid codebase, as changes in the superclass might affect all its subclasses.
Code Reusability:

Composition and Aggregation promote code reusability as classes can be reused as components in different contexts.
Inheritance promotes code reuse through subclassing, but it can also lead to a complex hierarchy and tight coupling.
It's important to choose the appropriate relationship based on the specific requirements of your software design. Overusing inheritance can lead to a less flexible and maintainable codebase, so composition and aggregation are often preferred when possible
