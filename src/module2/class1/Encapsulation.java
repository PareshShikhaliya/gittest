/*
In this cool bank account program, we have a class called BankAccount, which represents a bank account of a user.
Each bank account has some important information like the account holder's name, account number, and balance
(how much money is in the account).

To make sure that this information is safe and not directly accessible from outside the class, we use a special
 technique called "encapsulation." We keep these important details hidden inside the class by making them private.
  This means that no one can see or change the account holder's name, account number, or balance directly.
