Java does not support multiple inheritance, meaning a class cannot directly extend more than one class simultaneously. This decision was made by the Java language designers to address some key design goals and to avoid certain complexities that arise with multiple inheritance. Here are the main reasons why Java does not support multiple inheritance:

Diamond Problem: Multiple inheritance can lead to the "diamond problem," which occurs when a class inherits from two superclasses that have a common superclass. This can create ambiguity and confusion in resolving method calls and variable access. For example, if both superclasses define the same method, which implementation should be used by the subclass? The diamond problem is challenging to manage and can result in unpredictable behavior.

Complexity: Multiple inheritance makes the class hierarchy more complex, which can lead to maintenance issues and make the code harder to understand. It becomes challenging to identify the origin of a method or field when there are multiple superclasses involved.

Ambiguity and Overhead: Multiple inheritance can introduce method and field name clashes, making it difficult to resolve conflicts. Additionally, the overhead of checking and resolving method calls at runtime increases with multiple inheritance, impacting performance.

Interface Implementation: To address the issue of multiple inheritance, Java introduced interfaces, which provide a way to achieve a form of multiple inheritance through interface implementation. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit behavior from multiple sources without the complexities of multiple inheritance.

Java's Design Philosophy: Java was designed to be a simple, robust, and secure language. Limiting inheritance to single inheritance with interfaces helps enforce a clear and maintainable class hierarchy, reducing the potential for complex interactions and issues associated with multiple inheritance.

To address the need for reusing code across different classes, Java favors composition over multiple inheritance. By using interfaces and composition, Java allows classes to achieve code reuse and polymorphism without the complications of multiple inheritance. This design approach aligns with Java's goal of promoting maintainable and scalable code while avoiding the pitfalls of multiple inheritance.
